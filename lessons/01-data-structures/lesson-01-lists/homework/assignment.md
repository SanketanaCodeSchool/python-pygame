# Practice Exercise: Lists Practice

## Overview
This practice exercise will help you practice working with lists in Python. You'll create several programs that demonstrate your understanding of list operations, manipulation, and practical applications.

## Practice Tasks

### Task 1: Personal Information Manager
Create a program that manages personal information using lists.

**What to do:**
- Create a list of your favorite movies (at least 5)
- Create a list of your favorite foods (at least 5)
- Create a list of your hobbies (at least 3)
- Print each list with proper formatting
- Add one new item to each list
- Remove one item from each list
- Print the updated lists

**Example Output:**
```
My Favorite Movies:
1. Movie 1
2. Movie 2
...

My Favorite Foods:
1. Food 1
2. Food 2
...

My Hobbies:
1. Hobby 1
2. Hobby 2
...
```

### Task 2: Number Analyzer
Create a program that analyzes a list of numbers.

**What to do:**
- Create a list of 10 random numbers (you can choose them)
- Calculate and display:
  - Sum of all numbers
  - Average of all numbers
  - Highest number
  - Lowest number
  - Count of even numbers
  - Count of odd numbers
- Sort the list and display it
- Reverse the list and display it

### Task 3: Word Processor
Create a simple word processing program using lists.

**What to do:**
- Create a list of words (at least 8 words)
- Display the original list
- Find and display the longest word
- Find and display the shortest word
- Count how many words start with each letter
- Create a new list with only words longer than 4 characters
- Display the new list

## Code Guidelines

1. **File Name**: `lesson1_practice.py`
2. **Code Quality**: 
   - Use clear variable names
   - Add comments explaining your code
   - Use proper formatting and indentation
3. **Output**: Your program should produce clear, readable output
4. **Testing**: Make sure your code runs without errors

## Tips

- Test each task individually before combining them
- Use the concepts learned in class (indexing, slicing, methods)
- Don't forget to handle edge cases (empty lists, etc.)
- Ask questions if you're unsure about any requirements

## Extra Challenge

Create a simple "To-Do List Manager" that allows users to:
- Add tasks to a list
- Remove completed tasks
- Display all tasks
- Count total tasks
- Check if a specific task exists

Use input() function to get user input and create an interactive program.

Have fun practicing with lists!
